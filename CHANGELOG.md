## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Generate malli registries from an applied PostgreSQL schema through `psql`.
- Public API `pgmalli.core` (`generate!`, `path`, `registry`, `stale`, `unrendered`) and the
  `pgmalli.main` command line.
- Fixed renderings for enum types, value sets, ranges, non-blank strings, lengths, jsonb types,
  regexes and conditional nullability; everything else is reported as unrendered.
