# Changelog

pgmalli follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). Before 1.0, a minor release may
break what [Stability](README.md#stability) lists; its entry says what to do.

## Unreleased

The first release meant for use. The releases before it were development and are not
listed; the [README](README.md) describes what this one does.

* PostgreSQL schemas as malli: rows, insert and update schemas, enums, domains, keys,
  EXCLUDE constraints and triggers, and CHECKs as malli or evaluated as PostgreSQL evaluates
  them. Generated over psql or JDBC (`generate!`, `pgmalli.main`).
* Rows and datasets generated as the database takes them, written as HoneySQL INSERTs and
  kept as EDN fixtures (`pgmalli.data`).
* Rows typed as next.jdbc builds them from what pgjdbc returns (`as-read`, `read-options`,
  `transformer`).
* HoneySQL queries checked against the schema with no database, their arguments and rows
  typed, and each problem said as what to do (`pgmalli.honeysql`: `check`, `arg-types`,
  `row-schema`, `query-schema`, `explain`).
* Generated files kept current in CI (`generate/check`, `pgmalli.main check`).

Supported, each and later: PostgreSQL 16, HoneySQL 2.4.1066, next.jdbc 1.3, pgjdbc 42.7,
malli 0.20 and Clojure 1.11; babashka for everything but JDBC.
